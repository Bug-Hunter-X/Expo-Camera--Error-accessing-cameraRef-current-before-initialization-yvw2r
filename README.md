# Expo Camera Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API: attempting to access camera features before the camera has fully initialized.  This often leads to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Problem

The `cameraRef.current` might be null or undefined if accessed too early in the component's lifecycle, resulting in errors.  The solution involves carefully coordinating camera access with the initialization process.

## Solution

The solution involves using asynchronous operations and ensuring all interactions with the camera happen only after the `useCameraDevices` promise has resolved and the camera is ready.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the error messages in the console and the app's behavior.
